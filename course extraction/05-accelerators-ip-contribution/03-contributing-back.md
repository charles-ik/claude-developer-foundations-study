### Moving an asset from private reuse into shared infrastructure a maintainer accepts

You have already done most of the work that makes an asset shareable. When you packaged it for your own team to reuse, you pulled out the parameters, wrote down the assumptions, and bundled the eval. The parameters show the asset can be configured rather than rewritten. The documented assumptions tell the maintainer what environment the asset expects. The bundled eval gives them a way to confirm it still works. An asset packaged for internal reuse is already close to what a maintainer needs to accept it.

The contribution channel is designed to receive that packaged asset. It carries the version, the installation steps, and the components as a single unit, so a team that never spoke to you can install it and get the same working setup.

#### Match the contribution to the channel built for it

Contributing back means moving an asset from private reuse to shared infrastructure through a documented channel. Each channel is built for a specific kind of contribution. The Claude Cookbook is a GitHub repository of focused reference implementations. It is designed for self-contained single- or multi-pattern implementations demonstrated clearly and working end to end. Open-source MCP servers and tools each live in their own repository with their own contribution conventions. Sending a full multi-component application to the Cookbook is a mismatch. The repository is set up to review one focused pattern rather than an entire application, so a submission that large does not fit what reviewers are looking for and will stall. The first step is matching the contribution to the channel built for it. Putting a full application where a focused example belongs is one of the most common reasons a contribution never gets reviewed.

##### What makes verifying a contribution possible

A maintainer accepts a contribution they can verify. The bar is set by what they need to check, not by how clever the code is. Four things make that verification possible:

- 1 The code does one thing. A sprawling contribution forces a reviewer to reconstruct your intent before evaluating it.
- 2 An example shows it running. A reviewer should not have to build a harness to see the behavior.
- 3 A test proves it works. A test lets a maintainer verify the result without reproducing the reasoning themselves.
- 4 A short statement names the assumptions. Otherwise, the first failure becomes the maintainer's problem.

##### Rights and attribution come before technical review

Licensing and attribution decide whether a contribution can be accepted at all, which is why they come before the technical review. Code carried in from a customer engagement may have constraints on where it can go. Confirming you have the right to contribute it, and attributing anything you built on, is a gate the contribution must pass first. Skipping this is what turns a contribution into a problem the legal team must unwind later.

The example worked here is the customer service agent case. A reusable conversation-handling pattern, built during an engagement, gets stripped of customer specifics and prepared as a general example for the Cookbook. The contribution-back motion is shared across all three roles in this curriculum. Your job as the Developer is technical readiness: the focused code, the example, the test, the assumptions, and the rights check. The engagement context comes from the broader team.

##### The contribution-readiness reference

| Channel | What a maintainer checks | Licensing and attribution | The example and test bar to clear |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cookbook for a focused example, or the tool or server's own repository for a tool or fix. | That the code does one thing and that they can read it in full. | Confirm that you have the right to contribute code from an engagement, with prior work attributed. | A runnable example plus a test that proves the behavior, not just a description of it. |

**Handles well**

A packaged asset needs only the example, test, and rights check to become shared infrastructure others build on.

**Adds cost or complexity**

Clearing the maintainer bar and the licensing gate is real work on top of making the code run for you.

**Use a different approach**

When code carries an engagement licensing constraint you cannot clear, do not contribute it: escalate to the owner instead.

#### The pull request a maintainer could not verify

**Setup**

You opened the contribution with the exact code that solved your problem. This was the natural choice because it worked in your case and it was accessible. It worked for you, but that is precisely why it was missing everything a stranger needs to trust it.

This is an exchange from an internal channel so you can hear how a maintainer explains the silence on a pull request.

##### The exchange

```
Developer: My PR has been open three weeks with no review. The code works, I use it every day. What is the holdup?
Maintainer: It probably works for you. The problem is I can’t tell. There is no test I can run, no example that proves the behavior, and nothing saying what it assumes about the environment.
Developer: So, you want me to add a test and an example?
Maintainer: Yes. A contribution a reviewer cannot verify sits at the back of the queue until someone has time to reconstruct what it does. A focused PR with a test and an example gets reviewed fast because there is nothing left for me to reverse-engineer.
```

**Why it broke**

The code was correct. The contribution stalled because the maintainer could not verify it without reconstructing the developer's work. That gap is easy to overlook because the author already has the missing context. The example, the test, and the assumptions statement all seem obvious to the person who created the code. To the maintainer, however, they are not, and a reviewer who must reconstruct intent will always do it last.

**What to Watch Out for**

A pull request stalls on what the reviewer cannot verify. Before opening a contribution, add the example that shows it running, the test that proves the behavior, and the short statement naming what it assumes. Those three features are what move a contribution from the back of the queue to a fast review, because they leave the maintainer nothing to reverse-engineer.

### Checkpoint 2: Choose the contribution channel and the readiness fix

Try it now. Read the three cases below. Match each case to the channel built for it and match each case to the one readiness item the snippet is missing.

**Case A:** A focused tool that wraps a single API into a clean function. The snippet is the function and nothing else.

**Case B:** A full customer-service application a developer wants to share whole, including its UI and deployment scripts.

**Case C:** A one-line fix to an existing Cookbook example. The snippet is the corrected line, carried in from a customer engagement.

##### Match 1: case to channel

- Case A: A focused tool that wraps a single API into a clean function. The snippet is the function and nothing else.
  - Choices: The tool's own repository; The Cookbook, but only after the reusable pattern is stripped out as a focused example; The Cookbook example's own repository
- Case B: A full customer-service application shared whole, including its UI and deployment scripts.
  - Choices: The tool's own repository; The Cookbook, but only after the reusable pattern is stripped out as a focused example; The Cookbook example's own repository
- Case C: A one-line fix to an existing Cookbook example. The snippet is the corrected line, carried in from a customer engagement.
  - Choices: The tool's own repository; The Cookbook, but only after the reusable pattern is stripped out as a focused example; The Cookbook example's own repository

##### Match 2: case to the missing readiness item

- Case A: A focused tool that wraps a single API into a clean function. The snippet is the function and nothing else.
  - Choices: A test that proves the wrapper behaves; Reduction to a single focused pattern, because a whole application does not fit a review built for one pattern; The rights check, because engagement code can carry a licensing constraint that blocks the merge before any technical review
- Case B: A full customer-service application shared whole, including its UI and deployment scripts.
  - Choices: A test that proves the wrapper behaves; Reduction to a single focused pattern, because a whole application does not fit a review built for one pattern; The rights check, because engagement code can carry a licensing constraint that blocks the merge before any technical review
- Case C: A one-line fix to an existing Cookbook example. The snippet is the corrected line, carried in from a customer engagement.
  - Choices: A test that proves the wrapper behaves; Reduction to a single focused pattern, because a whole application does not fit a review built for one pattern; The rights check, because engagement code can carry a licensing constraint that blocks the merge before any technical review
