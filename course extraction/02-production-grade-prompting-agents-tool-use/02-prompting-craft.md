### System prompts, XML, few-shot, and output constraints

A prompt that works once in interactive use often breaks when it runs in production against untested inputs. The fix for this isn’t just adding more words, it is identifying which structural piece is missing from the prompt and adding that one piece. This section reviews how to read a failed output, then walks through the four techniques that produce the fixes.

#### Four techniques that give Claude a reliable output shape

When a first-pass response misses, the instinct is often to add more words to the prompt and run it again. However, that instinct can make the problem harder to isolate and rarely fixes it. Rewording changes how you say something but does not add to the structural piece of the prompt that’s missing. For example, if Claude is crossing the boundary between your instructions and your input data, clearer phrasing will not fix it, and if the output format keeps drifting, "please format this correctly" will not fix it either.

The failure mode tells you which of the four techniques is absent. Diagnose how your prompt is failing first, then add the specific technique that addresses that failure. The four techniques themselves are defined in full further down this screen.

| What you observed | What the prompt is missing | Why this technique is the fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The result comes back in the wrong shape: a sentence where you expected a label, prose where you expected JSON. | An output constraint. The prompt never specified the form, field names, or stopping point of the response. | An output constraint controls the form of the response independent of its content. Without one, Claude returns plausible text that the downstream parser was not built to accept. |
| The content is off: scope drifts, tone shifts, or Claude answers a wider question than you asked, and it gets worse deeper into the conversation. | A system prompt, or a more specific one. The behavioral contract was too vague to hold across turns. | The system prompt sets the rules that apply to every response regardless of the user turn. When it is underspecified, there is nothing holding role, scope, and format steady as the conversation runs on. |
| The task is right, but the structure is invented: Claude understood what to do and produced output in a shape you never asked for. | Few-shot examples. Claude cannot infer an exact structure from a description alone. | Few-shot examples show the pattern rather than describe it. One correct input-output pair gives Claude the exact shape to match, which a written instruction often fails to pin down. |
| Output is clean on the inputs you tested but breaks on a variant: an edge case, an unusual field, an input you did not anticipate. | A constraint covering the variant. The prompt handles the happy path and has no rule for the case the parser breaks on. | The prompt was validated against a narrow set of inputs. Naming the variant in the constraint, or adding an example that covers it, closes the gap the test inputs never exposed. |

#### Diagnosing a classification prompt that returns the wrong output shape

The rule is simple: name the failure, add the one technique that matches it, and re-run it. If it still fails, diagnose again. When a prompt keeps getting longer with every pass, that’s the sign you’re skipping the diagnosis step and just adding words.

The pattern below is the first row of the table in action: a prompt that produces the right content in a shape the downstream code cannot accept. The classifier understands the task and returns the correct category, but the form of that answer varies from run to run, so the router that consumes it fails. The missing piece is an output constraint, and the fix pulls in two of the other techniques to lock the label set and show the format. The walkthrough moves from the bare prompt that causes the problem to the constrained version that resolves it.

##### Worked example: a classification prompt before and after

A developer needs Claude to classify support tickets into three categories: billing, technical, and escalation. The first prompt is a bare instruction with no constraint on the output:

```
System: "You are a support classifier. Classify the ticket."

User: <ticket>I was charged twice for the same month.</ticket>
```

Claude returns "Billing" on some runs, "billing" on others, and occasionally a full sentence like "This looks like a billing issue." The downstream router expects one of a fixed set of labels and breaks on the inconsistency.

Read this against the table above, this situation matches what is described in the first row: the output comes back in a shape the parser cannot accept, so the missing piece is an output constraint. Adding that constraint pulls in two more techniques, because locking the label set and showing the format are jobs those techniques do better than a written instruction can. Few-shot examples show Claude the exact label and casing to return, and XML tags keep those examples separate from the instruction so Claude does not read them as part of the task:

```
System: "You are a support classifier. Classify each ticket into exactly one of: BILLING, TECHNICAL, ESCALATION. Return only the label. No other text."

<sample_input>My account shows two charges for April.</sample_input>
<ideal_output>BILLING</ideal_output>

<sample_input>The API keeps returning a 429 error.</sample_input>
<ideal_output>TECHNICAL</ideal_output>

User: <ticket>I was charged twice for the same month.</ticket>
```

Three techniques are doing distinct work here. The system prompt sets the output contract: exactly one label from a fixed set, nothing else. The XML tags mark where each example ends and the next begins, so Claude does not read the examples as part of the instruction. The few-shot pairs show the exact casing and format rather than describing it. Together they produce a result consistent enough to route programmatically.

The table below shows how we can stack all the four techniques together, where the prompt should be simplified, and where we should diagnose before adding more before too many iterations.

| Stack all four techniques | Stacking all four techniques against a clearly defined output contract. Tasks with well-specified formats and edge cases that can be covered by examples. |
| --- | --- |
| Simplify the prompt | Adding all four techniques to a simple task that only needs one. A "summarize this paragraph" prompt does not need few-shot examples and an output schema. |
| Diagnose before adding more | Prompts that are growing longer with each iteration rather than more precise. If you have re-prompted five times and the output is still wrong, diagnose the failure type before adding more text. |

#### When to reach for each technique

Now, let’s understand more about each of these techniques and when each one applies:

- **Interactive control:** System Prompts
- **Interactive control:** XML Tags
- **Interactive control:** Few-shot Examples
- **Interactive control:** Output Constraints

System prompts carry the behavioral contract for the whole session. Write them once and treat them as your persistent instruction layer. They define Claude’s role, the output format, and any rules that must not change between conversations.

XML tags are used when the prompt mixes inputs with instructions. A prompt that asks Claude to debug code using provided documentation is a good example; without tags, the code and the documentation look the same to Claude.

Wrap them with descriptive tag names like `<my_code>` and `<docs>` and the boundary becomes unambiguous. You do not need to use official XML tag names; descriptive names that match your content work best.

Few-shot examples are considered useful because they show rather than just tell. Instead of trying to describe the exact format you want, you provide one correct input-output pair and let Claude infer the pattern. To use this, wrap examples using consistent XML structure, for instance `<sample_input>` and `<ideal_output>`, so the boundary between example and prompt is clear. You can use some examples from your highest-scoring evaluation outputs rather than writing them from scratch.

Output constraints are the last line of defense before Claude’s response reaches your parser. You should specify exactly what you need, including field names, types, length limits, whether to include preamble, and what to do when data is absent. Use structured output features in cases when the format must be machine-readable.

#### The iteration loop: Diagnosing before re-prompting

When a first-pass response misses the mark, the instinct is to add more words to the prompt and try again. That instinct almost always makes the problem harder to diagnose and rarely fixes it.

Instead, diagnose the problem first, and then re-prompt based on your findings. The failure type tells you which technique is missing:

- **Wrong format:** This is caused due to a missing output constraint. The prompt never specified what shape the result should take.
- **Wrong content or scope drift:** This is caused due to an underspecified system prompt; the behavioral contract was too vague to hold across conversations.
- **Correct task but hallucinated structure:** This happens when few-shot examples are needed. Claude cannot infer the exact structure from a description alone.
- **Good output on simple inputs but breaks on edge cases:** The prompt handles the happy path but has no constraint covering the variant the parser breaks on.

The fix is structural, not a matter of phrasing. For example, if Claude is ignoring a boundary between your instructions and your content, clearer wording will not fix it, and if the output format keeps drifting, saying "please format this correctly" will not fix it either. In each case, identify which of the four techniques is absent and add it.

#### Moving output control from the prompt into the API with structured outputs

Everything up to this point shapes the output by writing instructions into the prompt and hoping Claude follows them. That works most of the time, but the prompt is a request, so a model can still return a stray sentence, a wrong field name, or malformed JSON that breaks the parser downstream.

The Claude API has a separate mechanism that removes that gap for production code. It is called structured outputs, and instead of asking for a shape in words, you hand the API a JSON schema, and the model is constrained at generation time to produce output that matches it. This technique is constrained decoding: as Claude generates each token, the API only allows tokens that keep the output valid against your schema, so a response that violates the schema cannot be produced in the first place.

Structured outputs cover two situations that show up in real pipelines. Each one constrains a different part of what the model returns, and you can use them on their own or together in the same request.

- **JSON outputs constrain the final response.** You set the `output_config.format` parameter with type `json_schema` and your schema, and Claude returns valid JSON in the response text that matches that schema every time. Reach for this when the model itself is producing the structured payload your code consumes, like extracting fields from a support ticket or formatting an API response, because it removes the parse-and-retry code you would otherwise write around every call.
- **Strict tool use constrains the inputs Claude passes to your tools.** You set `strict` to `true` on a tool definition, and the arguments Claude sends to that tool are validated against the input schema before your code runs. Reach for this in agentic loops where a malformed tool argument would crash the function or trigger a wrong action; this helps guarantee the call your code receives already conforms to the contract you defined.

The reason this belongs in the production code and not just in the prompt is because of reliability under inputs you did not test. A prompt-level instruction to return only JSON holds on the cases you tried and then slips on an edge case you did not, which is the exact failure the earlier classification example walked through. A schema constraint does not slip, because the API enforces it on every token rather than trusting the model to remember the instruction. That moves output correctness from something you verify after the fact to something the API rules out before it happens.

Constraining generation has costs, and a developer choosing this in production needs to weigh them rather than enabling it everywhere by default. Below are some of those costs you must consider:

- **The first request on a new schema is slower.** The API compiles your schema into a grammar before it can constrain output, and that compilation adds latency on the first call. Compiled grammars are cached for 24 hours from last use, so steady traffic on a stable schema pays the cost once, but a workload that changes schemas constantly pays it repeatedly.
- **Your input token count rises.** When structured outputs are on, the API adds a system prompt describing the expected format, and that injected prompt is billed like any other input token. The increase is small per call, but it is worth knowing when you are estimating cost at volume.
- **A guaranteed schema is not a guaranteed success.** Two cases still return output that does not match: a refusal, where the model declines for safety reasons and the response carries `stop_reason refusal`, and a truncation, where the response hits the `max_tokens` limit and stops mid-structure with `stop_reason max_tokens`. Your code still checks `stop_reason` rather than assuming every response parses.
- **It does not combine with message prefilling.** JSON outputs and prefilling the assistant message are incompatible, so a pattern that starts the response for Claude and a pattern that constrains the whole response to a schema cannot run on the same request. Pick the one that fits the task.

### The prompt that grew longer instead of better

**Setup**

Even though a prompt looks ready for production, it can still produce quiet failures. Sometimes edge cases cause fields to go missing or constraints to be ignored; when this happens, it’s often because constraints weren’t specified precisely enough.

#### Six revision passes, each one longer than the last

The prompt that we used in the previous example is given below: a developer needs Claude to classify support tickets into three categories: Billing, technical, and escalation. The first prompt is a bare instruction:

```
System: "You are a support classifier. Classify the ticket."
User: <ticket>I was charged twice for the same month.</ticket>
```

The trace below shows a developer iterating on a classification prompt, and although each pass adds more words, the output keeps drifting. This pattern emerges when a developer adds to their prompt without regard to constraint specifications.

| Pass | What was added | Output behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | "Classify this ticket as billing, technical, or escalation." | Returns full sentences: "This appears to be a billing issue." Parser breaks. |
| 2 | Added "Be concise." and "Use only the category name." | Returns "Billing" capitalized sometimes, "billing" lowercase other times. Router breaks on case mismatch. |
| 3 | Added three paragraphs describing each category in detail. | Output correct on simple tickets. For ambiguous tickets, returns 'billing/technical' instead of a single label. Parser breaks on the slash. |
| 4 | Added "Never return two categories." and "If ambiguous, choose the most likely one." | Works on 80% of tickets. Fails on tickets that could reasonably fit two categories (e.g., 'I was charged but the feature also stopped working'). Here it returns a full explanation instead of a label. |
| 5 | Added two more paragraphs about edge cases and a reminder to be precise. | The verbose prompt is now producing verbose output, over 2,000 characters per call, as long, unfocused prompts tend to produce long, unfocused outputs. The model calibrates response length and style to match the input. Latency has increased significantly due to output length, but accuracy has not improved. |
| 6 | Replaced all instructions with a JSON schema and two few-shot examples showing exact input/output pairs | Returns {"category": "billing"} on every ticket. Parser works. Latency drops. Accuracy on ambiguous tickets matches Pass 4. |

Two things went wrong across these six passes and they are worth identifying separately. Pass 4 is the diagnostic failure: the developer identified the wrong problem, added description instead of a constraint, and the output stayed broken. Pass 5 is the engineering failure: the prompt became verbose enough to induce a latency regression, and the model calibrates response length to match the input, generating over 2,000 characters per call, with no accuracy gain. The fix for both is the same structural move: an output constraint and two few-shot examples but recognizing that these are two different failures matters because the second one can appear even when the first one has been resolved. Here is the prompt with the output constraint and few-shot examples applied:

```
System: "You are a support classifier. Classify each ticket into exactly one of: BILLING, TECHNICAL, ESCALATION. Return only the label. No other text."

<sample_input>My account shows two charges for April.</sample_input>
<ideal_output>BILLING</ideal_output>

<sample_input>The API keeps returning a 429 error.</sample_input>
<ideal_output>TECHNICAL</ideal_output>

User: <ticket>I was charged twice for the same month.</ticket>
```

**What to Watch Out for**

Every pass made the prompt longer and none of them added the missing output constraint. The developer was describing the problem more precisely with each iteration, but Claude does not need a detailed description of what a billing ticket looks like, instead it needs to know that the only acceptable response is one word in all capital letters.

The fix is two lines: an output constraint specifying the exact format and a few-shot example covering the ambiguous case. The six-pass trace is a pattern to recognize early: if three re-prompts in a row have not worked, stop adding text and diagnose which technique is missing.

## S04 — Checkpoint

**Prompting Craft · 4 min**

### Checkpoint 1 · Fix the broken prompt

The prompt shown here extracts a JSON object from a support ticket with three fields: category, urgency, and a one-sentence summary. It contains one defect. Write the corrected system prompt that fixes it.

**Broken prompt**

```
System: "You are a support ticket processor. Extract the key information from the ticket below."

User: <ticket>My API key stopped working after I rotated it last night. I have a production deployment that is failing. This needs to be fixed immediately.</ticket>
```

- **Response field:** Write the corrected system prompt here…
- **Interactive control:** Reveal model answer
- **Interactive control:** Skip for now

**Model answer**

```
System: "You are a support ticket processor. Extract the key information from each ticket and return only a JSON object with exactly these three fields: category (one of: billing, technical, escalation), urgency (one of: low, medium, high, critical), and summary (a single sentence describing the issue). Return only the JSON object. No other text."
User: <ticket>My API key stopped working after I rotated it last night. I have a production deployment that is failing. This needs to be fixed immediately.</ticket>
```

Expected output: {"category": "technical", "urgency": "critical", "summary": "Developer's API key stopped working after rotation, causing a production deployment failure that needs immediate resolution."}

The defect was a missing output constraint. The original system prompt never specified the JSON structure, the exact field names, their allowed values, or the instruction to return nothing else. Without that contract, Claude returns plausible but inconsistent output that breaks any downstream parser expecting a specific schema.
