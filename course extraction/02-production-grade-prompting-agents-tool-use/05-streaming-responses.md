### Streaming responses and handling partial output without corrupting state

Every request so far has waited for the whole response to arrive before doing anything with it. That's fine, until the response is long, or a user is sitting there staring at a blank screen. Streaming sends the response in pieces, sending them along as the model generates them. That makes things feel faster, but it also gives your code a new job: now you are tasked with assembling the final content yourself based on the series of outputs, and you need to be prepared if the series stops early.

#### What streaming changes about the response

In a non-streamed request, the API hands you one complete message with every content block, fully formed. In a streamed request, the API instead sends a series of events that describe the message *as it's being built*. Your code listens to that series and reassembles the blocks. The message you end up with is identical to what a non-streamed call would have given you, but the difference is that *you* have to assemble the pieces, and *you* decide what to do if the events stop before the message is finished.

It helps to know what's not happening: the model isn't holding some live object open for you. Each event is its own small message describing a single change, a block started, some text or input got added to it, a block finished, the whole message finished. Your handler takes each event and applies it to the partial state it's been building up.

#### The event sequence, and what your handler does with each

| Event | What it signals | What your handler does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| message_start | A new message is beginning. Carries the message shell with empty content and initial usage. | Set up an empty content array to collect blocks in. |
| content_block_start | A new content block is opening, with its type (text, tool_use, or thinking) and index. | Make a slot at that index for the named block type. A tool_use block opens with its name and id, but no input yet. |
| content_block_delta | An incremental piece of one block: a text fragment, a fragment of JSON input for a tool call, or a thinking fragment. | Append the fragment to the block at that index. Tool-call inputs arrive as a partial JSON string spread across several deltas, you can't parse them until the block closes. |
| content_block_stop | The block at this index is complete. | Finalize the block. For a tool_use block, this is the first moment the accumulated JSON input is complete enough to parse. |
| message_delta | Top-level changes to the message: the stop_reason and final usage counts. | Record the stop_reason. It tells you whether the model finished or stopped for some other reason. |
| message_stop | The stream is complete. | The assembled content array is now the finished message. From here, treat it exactly like a non-streamed response. |

#### The rule that keeps your state from getting corrupted: don't act on a partial block

The tool_use block is the one to watch. Its input shows up as a partial JSON string spread across many content_block_delta events, and that string *isn't* valid JSON until content_block_stop closes the block. If your code tries to parse the input or run the tool before the block closes, it either chokes on malformed JSON or runs with half the arguments missing. So, the rule is simple: collect the deltas, and act only after content_block_stop for that block.

The same discipline applies when you add a streamed assistant turn to your conversation history. Add it only after message_stop, with every block fully assembled. A turn built from a stream that got cut off partway is incomplete, and the tool_use pairing rules will reject your next request if a half-built tool_use block ends up in the history.

#### When the stream stops early

Streams sometimes fail in the middle. A dropped network connection, a timeout, or a client disconnect can end the event series before message_stop arrives. The failure that really bites is treating whatever you've collected so far as if it were complete. A partial text block shown to a user is just a cosmetic glitch and a partial tool_use block written into history is a structural problem that corrupts the next turn.

- **Track completion on purpose.** A turn is usable only once message_stop has arrived. Until then, treat what you've accumulated as provisional.
- **On an interrupted stream, throw away the partial assistant turn** instead of saving it to history, then retry the request. Committing a half-built turn is exactly what breaks the following request.
- **Check the stop_reason from message_delta** before you continue a loop. A stop_reason of tool_use means your assembled tool calls are ready to run; any other value means you're on a different path, not the tool path.

**Handles well** Long responses and user-facing interfaces where showing output as it generates removes the blank-screen wait.

**Adds cost or complexity** You assemble blocks yourself, you must not act on partial blocks, and you must handle mid-stream interruption explicitly.

**Use a different approach** For short responses or backend jobs where no one is waiting on the output, a non-streamed call is simpler and removes the partial-state risk entirely.

### The stream that left a half-written tool call in the history

**Setup**

*A streamed response can look fine on screen and still corrupt the next request. The text rendered, the user saw an answer, and the handler appended the turn to history. What the handler did not catch was that the stream dropped mid-block, so the tool_use call it stored was missing half its input. The next request fails validation, and the error points at the next turn and not the stream that caused it.*

#### Postmortem: partial tool_use block committed to history after a dropped stream

An agent used streaming so its operators could watch responses generate in real time. The handler accumulated content_block_delta events and appended the assistant turn to history when its read loop ended. In testing on a fast local connection, streams always ran to completion, so the loop always ended at message_stop and the stored turns were always complete.

In production, a network blip ended one stream after the tool_use block had opened and received part of its JSON input, but before content_block_stop. The read loop ended the same way it always had, so the handler appended the turn: an assistant turn containing a tool_use block whose input string was truncated JSON. The operator saw a partial answer and retried. The retry request included that corrupted turn in history, and the API rejected it with a validation error pointing at the malformed tool_use block.

The team spent an afternoon inspecting the schema and the retry logic, because the error surfaced on the retry request. However, the actual cause was upstream: the handler treated 'the read loop ended' as equivalent to 'the message is complete,' and those are not the same.

**What to Watch Out for**

A stream ending is not the same as a message completing. Only message_stop means the message is whole. If your handler commits a turn whenever its read loop exits, an interrupted stream writes a half-built block into history, and the failure shows up on the next request rather than the one that caused it. Gate the history append on message_stop, discard the partial turn on interruption, and retry from the last complete turn. When a tool-use error appears on a retry, check whether the prior turn was assembled from a stream before you touch the schema.

### Checkpoint 4 · Repair the broken stream handler

The handler below streams a response and appends the assistant turn to conversation history. It contains one defect that only surfaces when a stream is interrupted. Identify the defect and write the corrected version.

**Broken handler**

```python
blocks = {}
stop_seen = False
with client.messages.stream(model=model, max_tokens=4096, messages=messages, tools=tools) as stream:
	for event in stream:
    	if event.type == "content_block_start":
        	blocks[event.index] = init_block(event)
    	elif event.type == "content_block_delta":
        	apply_delta(blocks[event.index], event.delta)
    	elif event.type == "message_stop":
        	stop_seen = True
messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assemble(blocks)})
```

- **Interactive control:** Reveal model answer
- **Interactive control:** Skip for now

**Model answer · self-assess**

```python
blocks = {}
stop_seen = False
with client.messages.stream(model=model, max_tokens=4096, messages=messages, tools=tools) as stream:
	for event in stream:
    	if event.type == "content_block_start":
        	blocks[event.index] = init_block(event)
    	elif event.type == "content_block_delta":
        	apply_delta(blocks[event.index], event.delta)
    	elif event.type == "message_stop":
        	stop_seen = True
if stop_seen:
	messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assemble(blocks)})
else:
	raise StreamInterruptedError(
    	"Stream ended before message_stop; discarding partial turn. Retry from the last complete turn."
	)
```

The defect: the append runs whether or not message_stop arrived. An interrupted stream commits a partial turn, possibly including a half-built tool_use block, to history. Gating the append on stop_seen means only complete messages enter history. When the stream is interrupted, raising causes the request to be retried from the last complete turn rather than corrupting context with a malformed block.
